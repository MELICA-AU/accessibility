# Shelter Accessibility
*ANALYSIS*

MELICA investigates the empirical basis of Cold-War preparedness in Aarhus by (1) reconstructing the everyday experience of individuals living in Cold-War Aarhus through spatial analysis of shelter locations and text analysis of written sources. This repository analyzes the overall accessibility of shelters on foot or by bike, utilizing sfnetworks to build a network of roads from OSM data within the radius of 3 and 5 km of Den Gamle By in order to test and illustrate how and within what timeframes the residents of Aarhus can reach shelter. This repository is the basis for shelter-equity analysis based on the accessibility indeces.
